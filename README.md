Portfolio involves creating of a specific webpage where we can have exposure to different languages for structuring of a webpage and to add certain style to it
I took the idea of creating webpage which is about different types of forest and their information in brief and also it includes various taglines about forests
I gave main heading of page is forests and sub heading is Different Types of forests and i wrote meta tag with device width we write this within the head
html code involves creating of div classes for different images let us take classes names as b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i and main div class where all these div classes 
placed is named as a
In each sub div class we place img url and content url and heading of specific forest we use a href tag for content url ang for image img src tag is used
main div class contains all sub div classes
Then we add style to webpage by using css code where each class is specified with attributes like color,font,border-radius,margin-top,margin-bottom
padding,background-color and within img class border radius is specified in px
finally,main div class includes the method flot:left for alignment of images at the end we should close all tags which are used and i used heading for taglines 
as Taglines
