Portfolio involves creating of a specific webpage where we can have exposure to different languages for structuring of a webpage and to add certain style to it,so for the style we write the external css file.
Then we add style to webpage by using css code where each class is specified with attributes like color,font,border-radius,margin-top,margin-bottom,padding,background-color and within img class border radius is specified in px.
I took the idea of creating webpage which is about different types of forest and their information
I gave main heading of page is forests and i wrote meta tag with device width we write this within the head and also a link below like <link rel...>which is used to apply the css to written html file
html code involves creating of div classes for different images let us take classes names as row,colmn,a,b,c,d.
In each sub div class we place img url and content url and heading of specific forest we use a href tag for content url ang for image img src tag is used
Also we include footer which is specified below and logo is included with its image url in the above.We use the <hr> tag for displaying horizontal line in the above and below of the webpage
In the css file for each class created is specified with a specific style by different attributes
Media quires are used to make the web page responsive.
